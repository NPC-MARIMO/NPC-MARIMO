Hi, I am Shivang Pandey
- Building Chaos into Code

I'm a self-taught MERN Full-Stack Developer passionate about building creative, impactful projects — and yeah, I'm 18.

Started coding in Feb 2024. Built stuff, broke stuff, learned fast. Now vibing with frontend, backend, APIs, SSR/CSR, proxies & more.

I’m driven, always leveling up my skills, and love sharing knowledge along the way.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me deep into chess, sketching, or bingeing anime.
